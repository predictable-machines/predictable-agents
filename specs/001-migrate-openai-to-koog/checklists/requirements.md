# Specification Quality Checklist: OpenAI Provider Migration to Koog

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**All items: PASS**

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality:**
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT needs to happen (library replacement, test compatibility) without HOW (no Kotlin-specific details in requirements)
- ✅ Written from developer/maintainer perspective with clear business value (leverage Koog capabilities, maintain compatibility)
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- ✅ No framework-specific implementation details in requirements

**Requirement Completeness:**
- ✅ All functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003: "pass all existing unit tests" is verifiable)
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and specific (e.g., "zero references", "all tests pass")
- ✅ Edge cases identified for API differences and behavior variations
- ✅ Clear scope boundaries defined in "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Dependencies on Koog repository and capabilities clearly stated

**Feature Readiness:**
- ✅ Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios
- ✅ User stories are prioritized and independently testable
- ✅ Success criteria define measurable outcomes
- ✅ No technical implementation details leaked (success criteria focus on outcomes, not how they're achieved)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- The migration task is well-defined with clear success criteria
- Edge cases appropriately identify potential challenges during implementation
- Assumptions section properly documents expectations about Koog library capabilities
